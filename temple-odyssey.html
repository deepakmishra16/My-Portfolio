                <h3>Unique Selling Points of Temple Odyssey</h3>
                    <li>
                        The game not only focuses on the commonly known facts but also delves into untold historical, legal, and mythological stories related to the temples. 
                        This unique content offers insights that are rarely covered in mainstream narratives.
                    </li>

                <h3>Our Future Plans for Temple Odyssey</h3>
                    <li>
                        At first, there will only be one temple in the game to explore and know the story of and that will be "Ram Mandir" 
                        and then we will add more temples in the game which is not covered in mainstream media with updates. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        At first, there will only be one character with one POV and then
                        we will add different characters in the game with different POVs such that the player can 
                        experience the untold stories of the temple with different perspectives.
                    </li>
            </ul>
